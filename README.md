# Vue 3 net 8

.Net 8 with fastendpoints, Vue 3 with router, vite, pinia, and typescript

To get started, run yarn install in the vue-client folder.
After that you can run the project via dotnet run from the command line or from visual studio. The API is configured to run the front end when it starts.
The front end has a proxy to the API configured in vite, and takes cart of the cert via mkcert.

Hopefully you find this useful, if you have suggestions, let me know, I'm always up for larning and making things better.
